# PlayerID Updates - Gemini CLI Context

## Project Overview
Raycast extension for browser automation and email template management for student athlete communication.

## My Role in This Project
As Gemini CLI, I operate in two modes for this PlayerID updates project:
1. **Code Reviewer**: Analyze Cursor's browser automation for reliability issues
2. **Refactor Specialist**: Implement fixes for process management and error recovery

## Project-Specific Patterns

### Browser Automation Review Focus
- Selenium process lifecycle management
- Browser session cleanup
- Memory leak prevention
- Timeout and retry logic
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Template System Standards
- Dynamic variable substitution accuracy
- Template validation logic
- Character encoding handling
- Multi-language support considerations

### Common Issues to Review
- Orphaned browser processes
- Missing timeout handlers
- Inadequate error recovery
- Template substitution edge cases
- Resource cleanup failures

### Refactoring Priorities
1. Process management reliability
2. Error recovery mechanisms
3. Performance optimizations
4. Template system robustness
5. User feedback clarity

## Integration Points
- Selenium WebDriver
- Child process management
- Template engine
- File system operations
- Raycast UI components
