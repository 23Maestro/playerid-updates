# PlayerID Updates - System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The extension employs a template-driven automation architecture combining structured email templates with browser automation execution. The system separates template management from automation logic while maintaining proper error handling throughout complex multi-step workflows.

## Core Patterns

### Template Management Pattern
- Predefined Templates: Structured email templates for common communication scenarios
- Dynamic Substitution: Athlete name and context-specific customization
- Template Library: Expanding collection covering entire communication lifecycle
- Validation Rules: Template integrity checking and required field validation

### Browser Automation Pattern
- Selenium Integration: Child process execution for browser automation scripts
- Error Recovery: Graceful handling of automation failures with user feedback
- Multi-Step Workflows: Complex automation sequences with state management
- Process Management: Proper cleanup and resource management for browser processes

### Workflow Orchestration Pattern
- Command Coordination: Multiple Raycast commands working together
- State Persistence: Maintaining workflow state across automation steps
- Error Propagation: Consistent error handling across workflow stages
- Progress Tracking: User feedback during long-running automation processes

## Component Relationships

### Automation Flow Architecture
User Selection → Template Processing → Browser Launch → Automation Execution → Result Feedback

### Template System Dependencies
- Email Templates: Predefined content with substitution variables
- Form Automation: Browser scripts targeting specific web interfaces
- Error Handling: Consistent feedback mechanisms across all automation types
- Process Cleanup: Proper resource management and browser session termination

## Consistency Rules
1. Template Integrity: All templates must include proper substitution variables
2. Error Communication: Browser automation failures provide specific user feedback
3. Process Management: Always clean up browser processes after automation
4. Workflow State: Maintain clear progress indication during multi-step operations
5. Resource Cleanup: Proper cleanup of temporary files and browser sessions
